				<h2>STAX Earspeakers</h2>
				<div className="introduction">
					<p>Come explore the world of electrostatic headphones. Stax electrostatic headphones strive
					to fix one major problem in audio. The problem of prohibitively high costs versus
					compromise.</p>
					<p>Good speakers sound better than good headphones. Good speakers also require you
					to position them perfectly for the geometry of the room which you should probably build
					so that the sound will reflect off the walls at the right angles to reproduce the sound
					of live music. If you took the best speakers in the world and put them in the wrong
					room they wouldn't sound very good</p>
					<p>The problem with conventional electrodynamic headphone and to an extent the planar
					magnetic headphone is compromise. The music sounds good, because music you like in any
						situatin is good, but it doesn't have the depth
					of sound speakers have. The details of the music can blend together into mush. If trumpets,
					trombones, and tuba are all playing together it will sound like a mushed together chord, instead
					of three different instruments playing together. It also sounds like music is being generated
					right next to your ears, which sounds unnatural.</p>
					<p>Stax created the Earspeaker to try and fix this compromise. They were and are a small Japanese
					company, that do not care about style or convience. All they care about is sound. They
					don't really advertise, not even in Japan. They went bankrupt twice, because they
					spent all their money developing headphones instead of selling them.</p>
					<p>Edifier bought Stax, built them a modern clean room environment in Japan,
					and according to Edifier CEO Wendong Zhang, STAX will be introducing a new headphone
					when STAX feels they have made something significant enough to bring to market.</p>
