This is the shopping cart project for the react section of the odin project. I decided to make
a tribute to my favorite headphone company.

The home page shows any upcoming products. Currently, there are no upcoming products.

The about page gives a brief history of the company, a brief timeline of the companies products,
and a basic overview of how electrostatic headphones work.

On the store page you can add different items to your cart. If you click on the image of the item
it will expand the item so you can get a better look at it.

Finally, on the check out page you can delete items if you change your mind and you get a total price. Since this is just an Odin Project project and not an actual ecommerce website, if you click checkout it will redirect you to a thank you page with links to the Japanese and Internatinal websites.
